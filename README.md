A discord bot i made to manage my server. This is so I don't have to rely on other peoples bots (this is the pythob version)

I am learning how to make bots for discord for my personal servers, to do things like automate tasks and allow me to have a single bot in my server instead of requiring mutliple closed source bots.

If you want to use this bot for any reasson you can, just know it may not be stable becasue its for testing currently.
